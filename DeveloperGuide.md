## Getting Started ##

To get started with the Google APIs Client Library for Java, take a look at the [available samples](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/source/browse?repo=samples).

For information about the structure of the library and its multiple components, see the [detailed setup instructions](Setup.md), which include [instructions for Maven users](Setup#Maven.md).

To ask questions, report bugs, discuss the library, and read the announcements, see the [Support](Support.md) page.

## Authentication ##

The library supports the following authentication methods:
  * [OAuth 2.0](OAuth2.md)
  * [ClientLogin (deprecated Google method)](ClientLogin.md)

## Batching ##

The library makes it easier to batch multiple HTTP requests/responses. For details, see the [batch documentation](Batch.md).

## Media Upload/Download ##

The library has convenient classes that help with [media upload](MediaUpload.md) and [media download](MediaDownload.md).

## Supported Java Environments ##
The library supports the following Java environments:
  * Java 5 (or higher), standard (SE) and enterprise (EE)
  * [Android 1.5 (or higher)](Android.md) (Note that this library's support for Android is [@Beta](https://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/#@Beta).)
  * [Google App Engine](GoogleAppEngine.md)


## GData Java Client Library (deprecated) ##

If you currently use the [GData Java client library](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/), you need to migrate to the Google APIs Client Library for Java. For details, see the [migration guide](http://code.google.com/p/gdata-java-client/wiki/MigratingToGoogleApiJavaClient).

## Contribute ##

This is an [open-source](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/source/browse/) library, and [contributions](BecomingAContributor.md) are welcome.
